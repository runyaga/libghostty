/// A child process connected to a pseudo terminal.

/// A pseudo terminal gives the child one terminal device. Output arrives as raw
/// bytes through [output], and input is written with [write]. Terminal programs
/// can change input modes while they run; [mode] and [modeChanges] expose the
/// most recent mode observed by the session.
///
/// The session owns native resources. Close it when it is no longer needed,
/// even after [exitCode] completes.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```dart
/// final session = PtySession.spawn(
///   const PtySpawnOptions(
///     executable: '/bin/sh',
///     arguments: ['-c', 'printf hello'],
///     initialSize: PtySize(rows: 24, columns: 80),
///   ),
/// );
///
/// final chunks = <int>[];
/// final output = session.output.listen(chunks.addAll);
///
/// final exitCode = await session.exitCode;
/// await output.cancel();
/// await session.close();
/// ```
